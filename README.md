# ada-gprahs
It's a small work-in-progress library for building
directed in-memory graphs in ada.

**Do not use this in any kind of productive code!**

# Building
You will need `gprbuild`.

To build the library itself (meaning the objectfiles etc.)
use `gprbuild -P library.gpr`.

To build the "test" use `gprbuild -P test.gpr`.

To build both use `gprbuild -P build.gpr`.
